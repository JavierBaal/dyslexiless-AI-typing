# DyslexiLess Audit Report

## Project Overview

DyslexiLess is a real-time writing assistant designed to help people with dyslexia. It monitors keyboard input and automatically corrects common dyslexic typing errors as the user types, providing immediate feedback and correction.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with the following components:

### Core Components

1. **Main Application (main.py)**
   - Entry point for the application
   - Initializes the configuration window if no config exists
   - Starts the keyboard listener service

2. **Configuration Management (config_manager.py)**
   - Handles saving and loading of application configuration
   - Stores configuration in `~/Library/Application Support/DyslexiLess/config.json`
   - Manages API keys and service selection

3. **Configuration UI (config_window.py)**
   - PyQt6-based GUI for configuring the application
   - Allows selection of AI service (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Mixtral)
   - Provides input field for API key

4. **Keyboard Monitoring (keyboardlistener.py)**
   - Uses pynput to monitor keyboard input
   - Builds words and sentences from keystrokes
   - Manages the correction process
   - Applies corrections by simulating keyboard actions
   - Provides system notifications for feedback

5. **Text Correction (text_corrector.py)**
   - Integrates with multiple AI services:
     - OpenAI (GPT-4)
     - Anthropic (Claude-3)
     - Mixtral
   - Handles API requests and responses
   - Uses a caching system to improve performance

6. **Correction Caching (correction_cache.py)**
   - Implements a caching system for corrections
   - Reduces API calls for previously corrected words
   - Uses context similarity to determine if cached corrections apply
   - Manages cache expiration and size limits

7. **Logging System (logger_manager.py)**
   - Implements a singleton logger
   - Logs to both console and file
   - Creates daily log files in the logs directory
   - Records application events, corrections, and errors

### Alternative/Deprecated Components

1. **Correction Handler API (correction_handler.py)**
   - FastAPI-based server for handling correction requests
   - Uses clipboard operations for text manipulation
   - Provides a simple dictionary-based correction system
   - Integrates with Karabiner-Elements for keyboard shortcuts

2. **Live Corrector (live_corrector.py)**
   - Alternative implementation using Hugging Face Transformers
   - Uses the facebook/bart-large model for corrections
   - Implements a learning mode for custom corrections

## Technologies Used

1. **Programming Language**
   - Python 3.8+

2. **Dependencies**
   - PyQt6 (6.6.1): GUI framework
   - pynput (1.7.6): Keyboard monitoring
   - httpx (>=0.24.1,<1.0.0): HTTP client
   - anthropic (>=0.7.4,<0.8.0): Anthropic API client
   - openai (1.3.7): OpenAI API client
   - requests (2.31.0): HTTP library

3. **AI Services**
   - OpenAI (GPT-4)
   - Anthropic (Claude-3)
   - Mixtral (via Together.xyz API)

4. **System Integration**
   - macOS notifications
   - Karabiner-Elements keyboard customization

## Current Status

Based on the log files, the application is functional but has some issues:

1. **Working Features**
   - Configuration management
   - Keyboard monitoring
   - Text correction framework
   - Logging system
   - Caching system

2. **Issues**
   - Anthropic API integration errors:
     - Initialization issues with 'proxies' parameter
     - 'Anthropic' object has no attribute 'messages'
   - Possible version compatibility issues with the Anthropic client library

## Resources

1. **Configuration**
   - Configuration file: `~/Library/Application Support/DyslexiLess/config.json`
   - Karabiner configuration: `karabiner.json`

2. **Logs**
   - Daily log files in the `logs` directory
   - Format: `dyslexiless_YYYYMMDD.log`

3. **Cache**
   - Correction cache file: `correction_cache.json`

## Processes

1. **Application Startup**
   - Check if configuration exists
   - If not, show configuration window
   - If yes, start keyboard listener

2. **Text Correction Process**
   - Monitor keyboard input
   - Build words and context
   - When space is pressed, add word to buffer
   - When buffer has enough context (3+ words), process correction
   - Check cache for existing corrections
   - If not in cache, request correction from AI service
   - Apply correction by simulating keyboard actions
   - Show notification with correction details
   - Update cache with new correction

3. **Configuration Process**
   - User selects AI service
   - User enters API key
   - Configuration is saved to file
   - Application starts background service

## Recommendations

Based on the audit, here are some recommendations for improvement:

1. **Fix Anthropic API Integration**
   - Update the Anthropic client code to match the current API
   - The error suggests the API has changed, and the code needs to be updated

2. **Code Consolidation**
   - There appear to be multiple implementations of similar functionality
   - Consider consolidating correction_handler.py and live_corrector.py with the main implementation

3. **Error Handling**
   - Improve error handling for API failures
   - Implement fallback mechanisms when a service is unavailable

4. **Testing**
   - Implement unit tests for core components
   - Add integration tests for the correction process

5. **Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive documentation for users
   - Document the API integrations and configuration options

6. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks
   - Optimize the correction process for lower latency

7. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Implement user-defined custom corrections
   - Add support for different languages
   - Develop Windows compatibility as mentioned in the README

## Conclusion

DyslexiLess is a well-structured application with a clear purpose and modular architecture. It leverages multiple AI services to provide real-time text correction for people with dyslexia. While there are some issues with the Anthropic API integration, the overall design is solid and provides a good foundation for future development.

The application demonstrates good practices such as configuration management, caching, and logging. With some fixes to the API integration and consolidation of duplicate functionality, it could be a valuable tool for users with dyslexia.
